# MayaToGcode
This is a Maya Export tool to take your geometry into your favorite slicer for 3D Printing.

This initial code I would suggest just copying and pasting into a shelf button.  You will also want to check and change your slicer program location.  Also be sure to associate OBJ files with your slicer in Windows.  For now this is only compatible with Windows.

It would be nice to have the settings directly in Maya and this call the slicer command line and ultimately generate a gcode file that is sent to the printer, either SD card or octoprint.  That would make this more of a complicated setup for all the different slicers out there, unless we just focus on Cura.
